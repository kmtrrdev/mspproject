            <h2>Welcome to My Role Model</h2>
            <p>I have always been passionate about cybersecurity, but my love for penetration testing truly began after watching 
    Mr. Ibrahim Hegazy's course on YouTube. His deep knowledge and practical approach inspired me to dive deeper into 
    the field. In 2025, I had the incredible opportunity to meet him in person at LEAP. I asked him many questions 
    about ethical hacking, security techniques, and the latest trends in cybersecurity. He generously shared his 
    insights, and it was an unforgettable experience. To make it even more special, I took a photo with him as a 
    cherished memory of that inspiring moment.
